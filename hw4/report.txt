Environment: macOS, ncat(instead of nc/netcat, from https://nmap.org/ncat/)

Test individually:
- client:
    - bi-directional communication with netcat: can send and receive message at both side.
        - Terminal 1: ncat -l -p 3333
        - Terminal 2: go run pbproxy.go -p passphrase.txt localhost 3333
- server:
    - bi-directional communication with netcat: ssh connect successfully, and can execute any command on Terminal 2.
        - Terminal 1: go run pbproxy.go -p passphrase.txt -l 3333 localhost 22
        - Terminal 2: ssh -o "ProxyCommand ncat localhost 3333" localhost
    - multiple connection to the server: Terminal 2 & 3 can function normally.
        - Terminal 1: go run pbproxy.go -p passphrase.txt -l 3333 localhost 22
        - Terminal 2: ssh -o "ProxyCommand ncat localhost 3333" localhost
        - Terminal 3: (same as the Terminal 2)
