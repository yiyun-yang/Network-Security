Environment: macOS, ncat(instead of nc/netcat, from https://nmap.org/ncat/)

My implementation:
1. Client:
- Start(Dial) a tcp connection to [destination]:[port]
- Receive and decrypt message:
    - Start a go routing to read message from the connection, decrypt it then write to standard output.
- Read plaintext traffic from stdin:
    - Encrypt message, then send to the connection.

2. Proxy-server:
- Listen on tcp port specified by [-l listenport]
- Wait for the connection in a for-loop.
- Start(Dial) a tcp connection to [destination]:[port] once a new connection is accepted
- Relay traffic within the for-loop using go-routine:
    - Read from accepted connection and decrypt message, then relay it to [destination]:[port]
    - Read from [destination]:[port] and encrypt message, then relay it back to the accepted connection.
    - In this way the listener can relay message in a non-blocking way, and can continue to listen for incoming
      connections, even if the previous session is ended.

3. Message:
- Generate message:
    - nonce: random bytes of length 20
    - salt: random bytes of length 8
    - AES key(len 32): use passphrase in keyfile and salt to produce a key of length 32 in PBKDF2 way
    - encrypt: use 32-length AES key and nonce to encrypt the message using AES-256 in GCM mode
    - encapsulate message: combine nonce, salt, and encrypted message together.
- Extract message:
    - nonce: first 12 byte
    - salt: 13-20 byte
    - encrypted message: rest bytes
    - AES key(len 32): generate using extracted salt.
    - decrypt: using the extracted nonce, and re-generated AES key to decrypt the cypher message.


My test processes:
1. Test Encryption and Decryption by running: go test -v. Related file is EncryptDecryption_test.go.

2. Test WITHOUT encryption/decryption individually (specify '-testmode' in command line):
    2.1 Client:
    - Bi-directionally communicate with netcat, send and receive message at both side.
        - Terminal 1: nc -l -p 3333
        - Terminal 2(client): go run pbproxy.go -testmode -p passphrase.txt localhost 3333

    2.2 Proxy-server:
    - Bi-directionally communicate with netcat: ssh successfully, Terminal 2 can execute commands normally.
        - Terminal 1(proxy-server): go run pbproxy.go -testmode -p passphrase.txt -l 3333 localhost 22
        - Terminal 2: ssh -o "ProxyCommand nc localhost 3333" localhost
    - Multiple connections to the proxy-server: Terminal 2 & 3 can perform normally, even if one of them disconnects.
        - Terminal 1(proxy-server): go run pbproxy.go -p passphrase.txt -l 3333 localhost 22
        - Terminal 2(client-1): ssh -o "ProxyCommand ncat localhost 3333" localhost
        - Terminal 3(client-2): ssh -o "ProxyCommand ncat localhost 3333" localhost

3. Integral test:
3.1. Test WITHOUT encryption/decryption (specify '-testmode' in command line):
    - Terminal 1(proxy-server): go run pbproxy.go -testmode -p passphrase.txt -l 3333 localhost 22
    - Terminal 2(client): ssh -o "ProxyCommand go run pbproxy.go -testmode -p passphrase.txt localhost 3333" localhost

3.2 Test with encryption/decryption (the complete test):
    - Terminal 1(proxy-server): go run pbproxy.go -p passphrase.txt -l 3333 localhost 22
    - Terminal 2(client-1): ssh -o "ProxyCommand go run pbproxy.go -p passphrase.txt localhost 3333" localhost
    - Terminal 3(client-2): ssh -o "ProxyCommand go run pbproxy.go -p passphrase.txt localhost 3333" localhost
    The results appear as the same as expected.
